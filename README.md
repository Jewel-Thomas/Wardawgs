Game Overview
“The Last Starfighter (stylized: TLS) is a 2D retro based endless spaceship shooter game. In this 
game, the player will have control over an 8 bit spaceship which can be maneuvered along the 
x-axis of the absolute bottom of the screen. The player can move the spaceship all along the xaxis freely (-1 to 1) but this is where the movement ends as no movement in the y axis is 
possible. 
The player will face an endless onslaught of meteors falling from the opposite side (meteors fall 
from the top of the screen to the bottom). 
The player will also have access to a shoot button which upon being pressed once sets off a fray 
of bullets (4-5). The bullets are endless and can be shot without any worry about running out of 
ammo.
The aim of the player is to shoot these bullets at the meteors and destroy the meteors while 
avoiding being hit by the same meteors. Once they are hit the player loses a chunk of their life 
and after a certain number of hits, the player runs out of life and therefore the game ends.
There are two kinds of meteors: 
1. Small meteors that can be destroyed with a single or two shots.
2. Huge Meteors which can be destroyed with 5 shots
The player will also get access to powerups which will aid the player in their quest. 
The Story of the Game
The game is set in a futuristic, near apocalyptic earth where the player is the last of the elite 
Starfighter Brigade. The Starfighter Brigade are the team that protects earth from any and all 
extraterrestrial attacks or problems. 
The game starts with the player receiving a call from the president telling them that they are 
the last hope Earth has against a meteor shower that is imminent to destroy earth. 
So, upon the orders of the President, the player has to shoulder the burden to go out onto the 
vast and unending space to face and destroy the dangerous meteor shower. 
The Power-Up System
The power up system is a system devised to help the player in their quest to save humanity. 
The power up system includes certain perks which fall down similar to the meteors falling 
down. There are three types of power-ups. These are:
1. The shield power up: The shield power up is a blue power up which once collected by 
the player provides a protective shield over the player for a stipulated amount of time. 
Over this time when the shield is active, the player, if hit by the meteor will not take any 
damage. But, once the shield power up runs out, the player begins to take damage 
again.
2. The Multi Shot Power up: The multi shot power up is a lightning shaped yellow object 
that falls down randomly. When the player collects this power up, they will gain the 
ability to let out multiple shots with one press of the shoot button. This will help the 
player destroy huge meteors with a single shot.
3. The fan shot power up: The fan shot power up is a red capsule shaped object that falls 
randomly. Once collected, this power up will help the player to gain an ability where the 
player can shoot shots all across the play area in a fanning shot technique. This will be 
much more effective than the simple linear shots that the player usually lets out

1. How was the game designed?
The Last Starfighter was made based on the Game Design Document given to us by the 
conductors of the competition, Zyngaa Games. The game is a 2D retro space shooter game 
designed on the game engine Unity. We availed the 2D project version of unity and made the 
game on unity version 2020.3. We made the game on a background that we made on 
Photoshop. The sprites were designed by us on Asepsprite and we made the cutscenes for intro 
on Premiere Pro. The game was a brainchild of two hours of brainstorming by the team on how 
we could make it different from other games and in our opinion, we have succeeded to a 
certain degree

2. What Architecture they have used. How they created the art, from where did they 
source the art assets. Who created the art?
The game architecture was inspired by a multitude of such space shooter 2D games such as 
Space Invaders 2, which was a milestone for games in the 2D mobile games genre. The art was 
all self made for the game with the team using AsepSprite and photoshop to make our own 
assets. These assets were then used in the game.
The art was created by everyone in the team. The other aspect of art being music was carefully 
and meticulously selected from YouTube as we had to source non copyrighted music. The music 
is 8 bit aracde style music which takes inspiration from the hit 2011 movie titled ‘Drive’ as it has 
the same solemn and lonely fighter vibe our game serves.

3. What is the future scope of the game? Can you see it becoming a multiplayer game? If 
yes, how?
The game has so much scopes as it is primarily a story driven game. We can and plan to build 
more on the story of the game. We can introduce more characters into the game, and we can 
drive the plot even further. The game will most certainly be made into a multiplayer by creating 
a leaderboard system where each player’s score will be logged and it will be tallied against each 
other. 
In other scopes, we can also include multiple game levels and include an enemy system where 
the player has to hunt down other extra terrestrial elements such a aliens from outer space 
which are about to unt down earth.
